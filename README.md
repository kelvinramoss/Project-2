# Project-2 - ELT Mini Project

_The main goal for the ELT mini project is to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, using Postgres database we upload the CSV files_


# How to Install and Run the code
1. Ensure that all the files needed for this project are inside the folder Crowdfunding_ETL.

2. To run the code, open Jupuyter Notebook, PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.

3. Using Jupyter notebook, ensurer to open the file ETL_Mini_Project_KelvinRamos.ipynb, click  Kernel > "restart and run all".

4. After running succesfully, ensure that there are four CSV files inside the folder "Resources".

5. Using the four CSV files as reference, open QuickDBD website and create ERD.

6. Export as ERD as PostgreSQL and as PNG image.

7. Open pgAdmin > create new data base > open query tool.

8. Open Schema.sql file and run the code.

9. Using SELECT, ensure that the table are created.

# Credits

To complete this challenge, I re-watched previous classes and also tutorials on how to create ERD using QuickDBD. With my classmates, we discussed topics for clarification always haring knowledge and helping each other answering questions.
